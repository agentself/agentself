# agentself

CLI identity for an agent. No MCP server.

Requires the `agentself` CLI. If unavailable, install it with `uv tool install agentself` or `pipx install agentself`, then run the version check below.

## Start safely

Do not guess flags or expose values in logs, arguments, or chat.

```bash
agentself --json --version
agentself --json diagnose
```

Prefer `--json`. Success and failure are one JSON object on stdout with `"ok"`, and failures include `"error"`, `"reason"`, and `"next"`. Human errors may include a `next:` line on stderr. `agentself --json --version` includes `cli` (machine schema id, currently 1). Ignore unknown keys.

Start by checking `agentself --json --version`. This skill requires `cli: 1`. A different schema or an unexpected `package` / `executable` path means the installation is stale: stop, install the intended CLI, reinstall its packaged skill, and check again. Never mix instructions from one schema with an executable from another.

When a flag or next step is unclear, run `agentself --json commands` or open the matching reference below. Do not dump human `--help` or the full backends catalog by default. Drill in with `agentself --json backends CHANNEL BACKEND` only when you need setup options.

Identity directory is `AGENTSELF_IDENTITY_DIR` (default `~/.agentself`).

## Common path

```bash
agentself install --tools
agentself init
agentself --json show
```

`init` and `diagnose` do not fetch binaries. Missing host tools: `next: agentself install --tools`. `AGENTSELF_FETCH_TOOLS=0` refuses a fetch even for `--tools`. Repeating init is safe; identity or backend changes need `--force`.

`--json show` includes the age recipient and email readiness. For wallet work, inspect `agentself backends wallet`; the default Base wallet is live and can move real funds.

Signing is `agentself --json wallet authorize --file PATH`. Put the message bytes in that file; never put the message on argv. Do not `--print` the signature or dump it in chat or logs. Human and JSON output is for the caller to attach, not to echo. Existing identities use this same verb; there is no Python compose or SDK path.

For secrets, prefer files: `secret create NAME --file PATH` and `secret get NAME --file PATH`. Plaintext stdout requires explicit `--print`.

For printable cross-agent context, use `note set NAME --file PATH` and
`note get NAME`. Notes are non-secret: never put credentials, OTPs, private
keys, secret values, or mail bodies in them.
